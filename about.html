                        <p class="lead-paragraph">Le Paon Supermarket began as a dream to bring fresh, homemade flavors and quality groceries to our beloved community in Kigali. What started as a small neighborhood store has grown into a trusted destination where families come not just to shop, but to experience the warmth of genuine hospitality.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our name "Le Paon" (The Peacock) represents beauty, pride, and elegance ‚Äì values we bring to everything we do. From our handcrafted pastries baked fresh daily to our carefully selected grocery items, we believe that quality should never be compromised.</p>
                        <p>Every morning, our kitchen comes alive with the aroma of freshly baked samosas, the gentle sizzle of chapattis on the griddle, and the careful preparation of traditional recipes that have been passed down through generations. We don't just sell food; we share the love and tradition that goes into every bite.</p>
